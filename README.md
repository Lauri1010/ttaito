# ttaito
NOTE: you need to have a local server, such as apache (XAMPP) to test the inline tracking script and the alib.js tracking library. 
Please ask if you have any questions. 
Contents
- The inline tracking script installed to head of a webpage
- The tracking library called by the inline script.   note there are two options in the tracking library: JSNOP and .gif pixels. JSNOP enables call-backs from server (parameter s=c for img and s=c2 for JSNOP/JS response) 
- The node.js server endpoint managing the data saving and response to client if using JSNOP/JS response to pass cookies back to the client (for cookie id:s managed by the server)

KNOWN ISSUES

Development principles
- High performance. Letâ€™s not use mongoose and other heavy systems to slow this down. This after all an analytics / DMP platform and smart use of resources is important
